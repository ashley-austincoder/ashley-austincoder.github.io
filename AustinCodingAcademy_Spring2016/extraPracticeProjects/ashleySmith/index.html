                <p>Austin Roller Disco was a night to remember! Austin Roller Rink hosted a BYOB event with live Disco Music, free roller skating, and all around super weird and super awesome times. Costumes and free-spirited personalities made you feel that you really were at a house party in the 70's. </p>

                <h2>30 Day No Alcohol Challenge</h2>

                <p>Today I completed a 30 day no alcohol challenge! It was a challenge for me, but once I committed myself I found that it got easier and not-drinking has a lot of amazing benefits. I ended up making several new friends out at bars since I was able to remember people and conversations clearly. I started dating someone I like, the first date was scary at first but now we know we actually get along without alcohol! I was able to workout I also saved a LOT of money compared to my friends who did drink when we went out.  </p>
